COM   Command script file for the ARM Debugger with chip 6230/6530 on platform.
COM   This INI file works with both the SYSCLK Bypass Mode and the SYSPLL Work around
COM   to be run under AXD  ARM Debugger.
COM   It should be automatically executed after new code has been loaded into Emulator.
COM   This can be acchieved by setting the Emulator appropriately.
COM   The script can also be run from the Command Line with:
